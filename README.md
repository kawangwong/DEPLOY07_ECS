<h1>Goal of Deployment</h1>
Create a pipeline that will pull docker images from dockerhub, rebuild them, then push them back up to dockerhub
<h2>Infrastructure:</h2>
An analogy to look at this pipeline is that the ECS will be used as the brains of the operation, the EC2 will be used as the processing muscle, and the resources gathered stem from GitHub and Dockerhub.
Utitilizing EC2 Ubuntu with Docker and as agent for building through Jenkins Push and deploying the new image as a container.
ECR Utilized to host a jenkins image for use for ECS so that multiple orchestration software can be created in little to no time.
ECS utilized as a container cluster service to faciliate building through github pulls of the Jenkinsfile and Dockerfile

<h1>Steps:</h2>
<h2>Prior</h2>
For this deployment we will be reusing a previous class's docker image that was provided by instructure to build into a a docker imge for deployment. This java application is a java web app that uses Springboot. This means that maven or something similar must be used to compile and then made into an image. The steps taken here will not be discussed, but a simplified way discussing what was done to the image prior, which created the target folder was the use of a maven image that was dockerized to target and compile the java files with pom.xl to a jar. We will be using that target folder created as our target for the Dockerfile.

Set up a dockerhub account as well as a github repository that have the Dockerfile and Jenkinsfile with the configurations that are in the current repository.

<h2>EC2:</h2>
1) Set up EC2 with Ubuntu on a VPC and remember the subnet (we'll call this subnet a).
2) Set SG here to allow SSH anywhere. For testing, this is fine, for production, this should be set to private with allowed outbound through an internet gateway.
3) Bootstrap an update and upgrade command, followed by adding repo for [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).
4) Add current user to Docker group to reduce need for sudo before every docker command.
5) Check docker installed using docker --version
6) Install Java jdk through default-jre package. (This is to allow Jenkins Agent to be used)
7) Download [AWSCLI2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html). (This is important)
8) Set up AWSCLI2 with credentials for AWSCLI. This is located in IAM -->User -->Security Credentials Tab.
9) Run `docker pull jenkins/jenkins`

<h2>ECS</h2>
1) Using EC2 
2) Go into your AWS Account for ECR. Set up a private ECR.
